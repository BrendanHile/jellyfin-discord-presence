Project Summary: This tool connects your Jellyfin account to Discord to show your friends what you're currently watching.

Features:
* Automatically updates your Discord status with the movie or TV show you are playing on Jellyfin.
* Shows if you have paused or are actively watching.
* When you're not watching anything, it shows you are browsing your Jellyfin library.

How to Use:
This application runs in the background. Once it's set up and running, it works automatically. Your Discord status will update on its own as you watch content on Jellyfin. There are no commands to type.

Notes:
* You must have the Discord desktop application open for your status to be visible.
* The initial setup requires technical steps to get credentials from your Jellyfin server.
