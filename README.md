# Jellyfin Discord Presence

A Node.js application that displays your current Jellyfin viewing activity as a Discord Rich Presence status. It periodically checks a specified Jellyfin user's session and updates your Discord status to show what you're watching, including details like series name, episode, and playback state (playing/paused).

## Features

*   **Real-time Status:** Displays the currently playing movie or TV show from Jellyfin on your Discord profile.
*   **Detailed Information:** Shows series name, season/episode number, and episode title for TV shows.
*   **Playback State:** Indicates whether the media is `Playing` or `Paused` with a corresponding icon.
*   **Idle Status:** Displays a generic "On Homepage" status when you are not actively watching anything on Jellyfin.
*   **Configurable:** Easily configured to point to your Jellyfin server and track a specific user account via environment variables.

## Requirements

*   **Runtime:** Node.js `>=21`
*   **Tools:** Discord Desktop client 
*   **Account:** A Jellyfin account.

## Quick Install & Dev

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/adwerygaming/jellyfin-discord-presence.git
    cd jellyfin-discord-presence
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  Create a `.env` file from the example:
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4.  Configure your environment variables in the `.env` file. See the Configuration section for details.

5.  Run the application in development mode:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will start, connect to Discord, and begin polling your Jellyfin server.

## Configuration

The application is configured using environment variables. These must be defined in a `.env` file in the project root.

| Variable | Description |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`      | The client ID of your Discord application. Used to authenticate with Discord RPC.  |
| `JELLYFIN_URL`           | The full URL of your Jellyfin server instance. Used as the base URL for API requests.  |
| `JELLYFIN_TARGET_USERID` | The user ID of the Jellyfin account you want to track. Used to find the correct session. |
| `JELLYFIN_ACCESS_TOKEN`  | An API access token for your Jellyfin account. Used to authenticate API requests.  |

Instructions for obtaining `JELLYFIN_TARGET_USERID` and `JELLYFIN_ACCESS_TOKEN` are provided in `.env.example`.

## Build & Run

The project includes scripts for development, production execution, and building.

*   **Development:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command uses `nodemon` to run the application with `tsx`, providing live-reloading on file changes.

*   **Build:**
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
    This command uses `tsup` to compile the TypeScript source into JavaScript in the `dist/` directory.

## API Summary

This application does not expose any direct user-facing APIs, CLI commands, or slash commands. Its sole output is the modification of your Discord user's Rich Presence status based on your activity in Jellyfin. The presence is updated every 15 seconds, as configured in `src/discord/Index.ts`.

## Deployment

This is a background script that needs to run continuously.

*   You can run it on a server using a process manager like `pm2` to ensure it stays online:
    ```sh
    npm install -g pm2
    npm start
    # Or directly with pm2
    pm2 start "npx tsx ./src/index.ts" --name jellyfin-presence
    ```

## Troubleshooting

*   **`DISCORD_CLIENT_ID is missing...`**: You have not set the `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` in your `.env` file.
*   **`JELLYFIN_TARGET_USERID is empty!...`**: You have not set the `JELLYFIN_TARGET_USERID` in your `.env` file.
*   **`Failed to connect to Discord PRC.`**: Ensure your Discord desktop client is running and you are logged in. This script cannot run in a headless environment without a running Discord instance.
*   **`Failed to get sessions info: 401. Please update your jellyfin access token.`**: The `JELLYFIN_ACCESS_TOKEN` in your `.env` file is incorrect, expired, or has been revoked (e.g., by logging out of your Jellyfin session). Follow the instructions in `.env.example` to generate a new one.
*   **`Couldn't find any active session. Try playing a video.`**: The script is running correctly but cannot find an active playback session for the specified `JELLYFIN_TARGET_USERID`. Start playing something on Jellyfin.
